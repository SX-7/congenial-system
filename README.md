## This is a funky java learning repo
That's it, there's nothing here really. Gonna learn with Java MOOC: https://java-programming.mooc.fi/

Also using the https://github.com/karan/Projects as additional exercise material

You might question my choices, but I don't question my professors.
Besides, it can't be worse than C++, can it? (<-- clueless)

Here's the "funky" in "funky java" btw: https://youtu.be/uNl6Sh01ZIU
